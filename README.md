- 👋 Hi, I’m @gracery.
- 👀 I’m interested in medical engineering and application of modern technology to diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening illnesses.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use deep learning for classification and semantic segmentation of medical imaging! Right now, 
we're working on creating a code for classification of Brain Tumors from an MRI dataset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning and deep learning/neural networks.
